# project objective
Overall I enjoyed walking on this project because I feel I undertsand working with css much better compared to javascript and I always considered myself a weak at designing but since working on frame works, I feel it changed my perspective when it comes to designing.

# project overview and challenges
My biggest challenge was aligning all my items to fit different screen sizes and when it switched to a small screens, my button and my input section where touching not putting a gap in between the 2.
My project initially was perfect on the desktop screen but when switch the other devices screens it cganged layouts to what I never intended to happen.

# mastery points
Going forward I feel, practicing on the css flex and grid games is the best way and fun way of overcoming the challenges I faced when working with tailwind.

# conclusion
I feel frame works are a good shortcut to avoiding writting long css codes but they require a deeper undertsanding of css.
